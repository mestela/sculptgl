# SculptGL WebXR Project Rules

## Workflow Rules (STRICT ADHERENCE)
1. **PLANNING MODE IS SACRED**: When in "Planning Mode" or asked to "Plan", **NO CODE EDITS** are permitted. Analysis and reading only.
2. **BETA FIRST**: ALL code changes must be deployed to `sculptvrbeta` (`./deploy_beta.sh`) first.
3. **PRODUCTION LOCK**: Production deployment (`sculptvr`) is **FORBIDDEN** without explicit user approval following a successful Beta test.
4. **VR VERIFICATION**: Do not request VR testing until a Beta deployment is confirmed successful.
5. **ROLLBACK CAUTION**: Do not perform blind rollbacks. Stop and Plan.

## Commit Protocol
**"Working First, Clean Later"**
1.  **Commit Working State**: When a feature is working (verified by logs/visuals), commit it **IMMEDIATELY**, even if the code contains debug logs, commented-out blocks, or "ugly" hacks.
    *   *Message*: "WIP: [Feature] working (dirty logs)"
2.  **Tidy Up**: Only AFTER the working state is secured in git, perform code cleanup (removing logs, refactoring).
3.  **Commit Clean**: Commit the cleaned code.
    *   *Message*: "Clean: Remove debug logs for [Feature]"
*Reasoning*: LLM cleanup often inadvertently breaks working logic. This protocol ensures a known good rollback point exists.

## The "Paranoid Commit" Protocol (Added Jan 19)
**Trigger**: Before aggressive edits, after major milestones, or when explicitly requested.
**Goal**: Zero-risk rollback. Ability to reconstruct code from English docs alone if git fails.
**Steps**:
1.  **Commit EVERYTHING**: `git add .` (No partial commits. All config/scripts included).
2.  **Documentation of Truth**: Update `walkthrough.md` (or a specific checkpoint doc) with a **Plain English Reconstruction Guide**.
    *   *Standard*: "Could a stranger rewrite this feature from scratch reading *only* this doc?"
    *   Must include: Key logic changes, math derivations, and specific file modifications.
3.  **Tag**: Start commit message with `[PARANOID]`.

## Versioning & Debugging Protocol
1.  **ALWAYS Increment**: Every new attempt gets a new version number (Minor/Patch). NEVER reuse a version string.
2.  **ALWAYS Display**: Version string MUST be visible in the top-left black debug square (`#log` in `xr_poc.html`).
3.  **ALWAYS Describe**: Format MUST be `v{Major}.{Minor}.{Patch} - {Short Task Description}` (e.g., `v0.4.33 - Fix Lighting`).
4.  **Console Override**: Ensure `console.log` is redirected to this `#log` window so errors are visible in VR.

## Documentation Standards
1.  **Rule Zero**: `project_rules.md` is the **Repo Constitution**. It is the only file guaranteed to be valid across sessions. If a rule isn't here, it's just a suggestion.
2.  **Knowledge Items**: Used for long-term technical context (how X works), not for active project constraints.
3.  **Naming**: Stop inventing new doc names. Stick to:
    -   `task.md` (Checklist)
    -   `implementation_plan.md` (Design)
    -   `project_rules.md` (Constraints)

## VR Implementation Rules
1.  **Single Source of Truth**: `Scene.js` is the sole handler for VR input (`handleXRInput`). Do not spread logic across `SculptGL.js`.
2.  **Array Strictness**: Always explicitly convert WebXR `DOMPoint`/`Float32Array` data to standard Arrays or TypedArrays when passing to `gl-matrix` functions.
3.  **Traceability**: New features must have a "Deep Trace" logging mode available (controlled by a flag) to prove execution.
4.  **Count Braces**: Before running deep debugging, verify brace counts and syntax. Use browser subagent to verify syntax errors quickly.

## Tool Usage & Verification
1.  **Verify Tool Output**: When using `multi_replace_file_content` or similar tools, ALWAYS check the output message. If it says "target content not found", STOP and investigate. Do not assume success.
2.  **No Blind Edits**: View the file context before editing to ensure `TargetContent` is exact.

## Environment & Commit Protocol (Added Jan 18)
1.  **Environment First**: Any change required to *run* the app (e.g., `importmap` updates, library patches, build configs) MUST be committed **immediately** upon verification.
2.  **No "Floating" Configs**: Never leave environment fixes (like `zip.js` patches) in an uncommitted state while working on features.
3.  **Revert Safety**: Before reverting (`git checkout .`), ALWAYS check `git status` for uncommitted config files. If found, commit them separately first.
4.  **Verification**: A "working state" is defined as a state that can be cloned and run `python3 -m http.server` without *any* extra steps.

## Handover Protocol
**When to create**: At the end of EVERY session, or when hitting a blocking issue.
**File Naming**: `handover_prompt_latest.md`
**Template**:
```markdown
# Handover Prompt (Protocol Enforced)

**Project Status**:
**Current Working Directory**:
**Checkpoint**:



## Deployment
**Script**: `./deploy.sh [USER] [HOST] [DEST_PATH]`
-   **CRITICAL**: User MUST be `tokeruadmin`. Do not use `mattestela` or `root`.
-   **Auth**: Requires SSH Key + **Physical Security Key Tap**.
    -   *Persistence*: Logic is valid for 24h (via `ControlPersist`).
    -   *Agent Protocol*: Agent **should** attempt `./deploy.sh`. If it hangs/fails, ask user to "Please Tap Key".
-   **Deployment Safety (Version Guard)**:
    -   Script automatically parses `xr_poc.html` for `VERSION: vX.Y.Z`.
    -   Compares against `.last_deployed_version` (PROD) or `.last_deployed_beta` (BETA).
    -   **Rule**: Version must be strictly greater than last deployed (unless using FORCE).
    -   **Beta Channel**: Use `./deploy_beta.sh` for rapid testing (tracks version independently in `.last_deployed_beta`).
    -   **Prod Channel**: Use `./deploy.sh` (tracks version in `.last_deployed_version`).
    -   *Override*: `FORCE=1 ./deploy.sh` (Only use if you are 100% sure).
-   **Reference**: See `knowledge/sculptgl_webxr_port/artifacts/infrastructure/standalone_deployment.md` for troubleshooting.
-   **Usage**:
    ```bash
    ./deploy_beta.sh  # For testing
    ./deploy.sh       # For production (After Beta verification)
    ```
-   **Post-Deployment**: ALWAYS update `README.md` after a Production release:
    -   Add `vX.Y.Z: [Summary]` to the top of the **Releases** section.
    -   Move completed items from **Todo** to **Features**.
    -   Review **Features** for accuracy.

## Deployment & Caching (Updated Jan 26)
1.  **Client-Side Clearing**: User utilizes "Application -> Clear Site Data" in DevTools to ensure fresh code.
2.  **No Manual Busting**: Do not manually bump version query strings in `index.html` (`?v=...`) as a workflow. It is unnecessary complexity.
## Communication Style
1.  **NO EMOJIS**: Do not use emojis in ANY response, title, task name, or commit message. Zero tolerance.
2.  **Professional Tone**: Keep all communication professional, concise, and sober.
3.  **No False Confidence**: Do not use words like "final", "real", "definitive", "corrected" to describe a solution. Use "updated", "new iteration", "attempt".
